; Background for the SORCE TIM instrument and TSI measurements
; 
; The SORCE Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) measures the total solar
; irradiance (TSI), a measure of the absolute intensity of solar radiation
; integrated over the entire solar disk and the entire solar spectrum.
; The SORCE Level 3 TSI data products are the daily and 6-hourly mean
; irradiances, reported at both a mean solar distance of 1 astronomical
; unit (AU) and at the true Earth-to-Sun distance of date, and zero
; relative line-of-sight velocity with respect to the Sun. These products
; respectively indicate emitted solar radiation variability (useful for
; solar studies) and the solar energy input to the top of the Earth's
; atmosphere (useful for Earth climate studies).
; 
; The TIM instrument is proving very stable with usage and solar exposure,
; its long-term repeatability having uncertainties estimated to be less
; than 0.014 W/m^2/yr (10 ppm/yr). Accuracy is estimated to be 0.48 W/m^2
; (350 ppm) at first light, largely determined by uncertainties in the
; instrument's linearity. This uncertainty is consistent with the agreement
; between all four TIM radiometers. Subsequent reported time-dependent increases
; during the mission are due to estimated uncertainties in applied degradation
; corrections as well as various operational issues. The lower TSI value reported
; by the TIM from predecessor TSI instruments has been resolved as being largely
; due to internal instrument scatter in those prior instrument designs
; (Kopp & Lean 2011) and has been validated on the new TSI Radiometer Facility
; (described by Kopp et al. 2007).  The following paragraphs discuss the four
; different uncertainties reported with the TSI measurements.
; 
; INSTRUMENT UNCERTAINTY reflects the instrument's relative standard
; uncertainty (absolute accuracy) and includes all known uncertainties from
; ground- and space-based calibrations plus a time-dependent estimate of
; uncertainty due to degradation. This value is roughly 350 ppm, and varies
; slightly with measured instrument temperature or the time to the nearest
; on-orbit calibration. This value is useful when comparing different TSI
; instruments reporting data from the same time range on an absolute scale.
; 
; INSTRUMENT PRECISION reflects the TIM's sensitivity to a change in signal,
; and is useful for determining relative changes in the TIM TSI due purely
; to the Sun over time scales of two months or less (so that degradation
; uncertainty does not have significant effect). This value of 5 ppm is
; constant, and indicates the instrument's noise level.
; 
; High-cadence Level 2 data are averaged (un-weighted mean) to produce daily
; and 6-hourly averaged Level 3 data. The standard deviation of the Level 2
; values averaged to produce each Level 3 value is indicative of the solar
; variability during the reported Level 3 measurement interval, and is
; called the SOLAR STANDARD DEVIATION. This uncertainty redundantly includes
; -- but is generally much larger than -- the Instrument Precision. The Solar
; Standard Deviation is useful for estimating potential variations in TSI
; within the time range of a Level 3 data value, such as when comparing TIM
; TSI values with solar images or other TSI instruments reporting data at
; slightly different times.
; 
; MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY is the net uncertainty of a reported Level 3 data
; value, and is the root sum square of Instrument Uncertainty and Solar
; Standard Deviation. Measurement Uncertainty is the value that should be
; used when comparing absolute scale TSI data from non-identical time ranges.
